AWS Services Project Template
📌 Project Title
Automated Slot Booking and Hairstyle Recommendation System

🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of AWS services to build a scalable and serverless salon management system. It automates slot booking, provides hairstyle recommendations using machine learning, and minimizes waiting times with real-time updates.

🛠️ Features
Serverless Architecture: Powered by AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
Machine Learning: Hairstyle recommendations using Amazon SageMaker.
Data Management: User and appointment data stored in Amazon DynamoDB.
Image Storage: Facial recognition images stored securely in Amazon S3.
Monitoring & Logging: Integrated with CloudWatch for debugging and performance analysis.
🖥️ Technologies Used
AWS Services:
Lambda
API Gateway
SageMaker
DynamoDB
S3
CloudWatch
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js (API integration with AWS services)
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow/PyTorch (model training)
🚀 Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
AWS account with access to Lambda, SageMaker, DynamoDB, S3, and API Gateway.
Node.js and npm installed.
Basic knowledge of AWS and serverless architecture.
2. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-salon-management.git
cd aws-salon-management
3. Setup AWS Resources
Use the provided CloudFormation template (cloudformation-template.yaml) to deploy all required AWS resources.
Upload the trained machine learning model to an S3 bucket.
4. Configure Environment
Update the config.json file with:

AWS access keys
DynamoDB table names
S3 bucket names
API Gateway endpoints
5. Deploy Backend Code
Run the following command to deploy the Lambda functions:

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run deploy
📚 Usage
Frontend Application:

Navigate to the frontend directory.
Run npm install && npm start to launch the React app.
API Integration:

Test API endpoints using Postman or directly from the frontend.
Model Predictions:

Upload a user image via the frontend.
The system returns hairstyle recommendations based on facial features.
